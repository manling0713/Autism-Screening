# Predicting Model for Autism
The analysis focuses on early diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in adults to reduce healthcare costs. Its main goal is to develop strategies for early ASD diagnosis, emphasizing the importance of timely interventions. Utilizing a global dataset from ASD screening applications, the research encompasses data collection, preprocessing, and analysis using machine learning models. The key findings highlight the effectiveness of early diagnosis in managing ASD and its impact on healthcare resource allocation. This project is significant due to the high healthcare costs associated with ASD, particularly in undiagnosed adults. Early diagnosis enables more effective and cost-efficient interventions, reducing long-term care expenses. By enhancing existing screening methods and raising public awareness, the research contributes to a more efficient healthcare system, addressing the challenges of prolonged diagnosis periods and promoting informed decision-making in ASD management.
